One of our ideas is a web app that allows users to input ingrediants they
have and find a list of recipes that contain these ingrediants as well as
their nutrient content. This app will be beneficial for users who want to
take advantange of the ingrediants in their fidge without having to go 
grocery shopping and users who want to explore alternative recipe for a 
particular dish. We will use a non relational database such as mongoDB
to store the ingrediants and recipes data. So far the two public APIs we've
chose are Spoonacular and Recipal. Spoonacular allows you to seach recipe 
by ingrediants and Recipal provides nutrition analysis.
