Pitch #1: Generate Recipes by Ingredients App
This web app allows users to input ingredients they have to find recipes and their nutritional contents. This app is beneficial to users who want to use the existing ingredients in their fridge and users who want to explore alternative recipes. We will use a database to store previous and favorite recipes and the user's profile info. The two public APIs we've chose are Spoonacular and Recipal. Spoonacular allows you to search recipe by ingredients and Recipal provides nutrition analysis. The user can choose to log in using Facebook or Twitter. On the front end, we want the user to have the ability to type in a few of their ingredients and see the top 10 recipes. We also want the user to be able to save recipes into their favorite list for future reference. In the back end, we want fetch the recipes and their nutritional values and save the recipes in the database. 


Pitch #2: Fitbit and Apple Health Connection App

Although Apple Health and Fitbit are both health apps, they cannot sync with each other. When steps are counted on a Fitbit device, it is synced on the Fitbit app, but the data is not shared to Apple Health. Our app syncs these two apps together by the number of steps, walking distance, heart rate, etc. It also displays the past syncs so that the user can keep track of when to sync the two app again. We will utilize a database to store user's profile information and keep track of the data of a few previous syncs. The two API that we will use is the HealthKit API and Fitbit API. They will give us the data needed for syncs. Users can choose to log into their profile through Facebook or Google using OAuth. The app will have a minimal front end because we will only need to display the options of syncing from Fitbit to Apple Health or vice versa and display sync history. Most of our work/syncing will be done in the back end.
