Pitch #2: Fitbit and Apple Health Connection App

Although Apple Health and Fitbit are both health apps, they cannot sync with each other. When steps are counted on a Fitbit device, it is synced on the Fitbit app, but the data is not shared to Apple Health. Our app will sync these two apps together by the number of steps, walking distance, heart rate, etc. It also displays the past syncs so that the user can keep track of when to sync the two app again. We will utilize a database to store user's profile information and keep track of the data of a few previous syncs. The two API that we will use is the HealthKit API and Fitbit API. They will give us the data needed for syncs. Users can choose to log into their profile through Facebook or Google using OAuth. The app will have a minimal front end because we will only need to display the options of syncing from Fitbit to Apple Health or vice versa and display sync history. Most of our work/syncing will be done in the back end.
